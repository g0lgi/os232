* [Linux Crash Course - Easy Terminal Commands for Inspecting Hardware](https://youtu.be/oGyJr-iUwt8?si=59V2boc0XfmlFekg) --- 
Some easy-to-use commands you can use to inspect hardware.

* [Operating System course site](https://os.vlsm.org/) ---
  This site contains links to lecture materials, exam questions, and laboratory materials for the Operating Systems Course at Universitas Indonesia's Faculty of Computer Science.
  I find it interesting that all of the course's material from previous years are neatly compiled in a site.

* [(OSC10) Silberschatz et. al.: Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition, 2018](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/)
  This site contains the main textbook used for the Operating Systems Course at Universitas Indonesia's Faculty of Computer Science, with slides too!
  I find a free textbook about the course very interesting.
